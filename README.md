Security audits are a cornerstone of enhancing an organization's security posture. In the realm of cybersecurity, audits are conducted to identify flaws and weaknesses in an organization's security policies, internal security networks, and legal compliance. In this project, a fictional company named 'Botium Toys' is undergoing a security audit with the assistance of its security manager and security teams.

Initially, the security manager outlines the scope, which encompasses the areas of the organization that require assessment, and establishes the goals that the organization aims to achieve in terms of security. Subsequently, a risk assessment is conducted to pinpoint the primary security threats facing the organization. This step involves identifying potential vulnerabilities and evaluating their potential impact.

Following the risk assessment, a controls assessment is carried out. This entails examining the existing security measures to determine their adequacy and effectiveness. The assessment also includes verifying whether previously implemented security measures are properly in place and functioning as intended.

Lastly, compliance is evaluated. The audit checks whether Botium Toys adheres to the laws and regulations established by external governing bodies. This process involves ensuring that the organization is in alignment with relevant legal requirements.

Throughout the entire audit process, the security manager and teams collaborate to identify areas of improvement and implement necessary security enhancements. By addressing vulnerabilities, enhancing controls, and ensuring compliance, Botium Toys can strengthen its overall security posture
